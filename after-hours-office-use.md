# After Hours Office Use

The Company office may come to life after dark. During non-working hours, employees may reserve our office and invite one adult guest for special occasions such as a date night or an activity like watching a movie. To reserve the office and schedule an activity, contact [Michelle](https://trello.com/c/dC4SJ9cx/24-stoll-michelle) via email or Slack [Details on Terms and Conditions for After Hours Office Use].
