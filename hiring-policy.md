**HIRING PROCESS AND PROCEDURES:**  The following process and procedures are helpful guidelines to hiring the most qualified candidates for positions:

1. **REQUISITIONS:** Personnel requisitions to fill a position may be submitted to the human resource director and approved by a Company officer.  Requisitions should indicate the reason for opening, essential job description, functions and qualifications, title, hours/shifts, status of employment, and any special recruitment (advertising) instructions.

1. **JOB POSTING:** Job openings may be announced by word of mouth or posted on the Companyâ€™s website for employees to review.  Postings may be updated as needed or remain posted until the position is filled.  The HR department is responsible for placing any external advertising if needed.

1. **RECOMMENDATIONS** BY RELATIVES: Employment of a relatives is common practice and generally not objectionable; however, related employees ordinarily should not work in positions of direct authority where a person might be able to assign, check, process, review, approve, audit or otherwise affect the work of their relative.
